# Python-Weather-API
This Python Weather App (using PyQt5 and OpenWeather API) fetches real-time weather details for a user-entered city. It displays the temperature (°C), weather description, and an emoji representation of the conditions. The app features a clean GUI, error handling for API failures, and user input validation. 🌦️☀️⛈️
